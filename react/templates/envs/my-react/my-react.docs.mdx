## Overview

A standard React development environment for building modular and reusable MFEs.

### Usage instructions

Create a **variant** in project's `workspace.json` file.  
Set this extension as the variant's extension.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{templates/ui/**}, {templates/pages/**}": {
      "teambit.react/templates/env/my-react": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Compilation

By default, Component compilation is done with the TypeScript compiler. Target format is `ES2015` which
supports execution from both NodeJS and browser runtimes for server-side rendering.

### Testing

Component testing is done through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with the default `teambit.react/react`.

### Extend

This component development environment can be easily extended. Just add the env as a dependency of your extension
and use the extension API.

### Adding a Theme

A custom theme has been added to the env which wraps all the composition files with the required theme so they can developed with the correct themeing rather than the browsers default.

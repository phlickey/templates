## React Component for rendering a Welcome Page

A page component ready to be consumed in your app.

### Component usage

```js
<Welcome />
```

## Design Embed

Embed your Figma designs so that designs and compositions live side by side. Any changes made to the figma file will be updated automatically here. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom in and out of the design and click on the name of the Figma File to go direct to the page in Figma.

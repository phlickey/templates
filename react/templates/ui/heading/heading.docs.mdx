## Heading

A heading component that renders a different heading element depending on what you pass into it. It also renders a text for the Heading.

### Component usage

```js
<Heading element="h2">heading</Heading>
```

### Live Playground

Modify the text to see it change live:

```js live
<Heading element="h2">
  heading<div>more heading</div>
</Heading>
```
